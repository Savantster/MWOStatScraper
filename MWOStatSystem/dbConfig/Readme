The MWOStatSystemDB.sqlce file is the schema for the entire database. The individual "insert" files
are the core data I have for the mechs/weapons I've used, they are here for example purposes and to
minimize the amount of initial cleanup work you'll have to do to start using the system.

USE: Create a database called MWOStatSystemDB using some tool (make sure it's a Sql CE 4.0 database). 
  Attach to it, then run the MWOStatSystemDB.sqlce (open an Sql Editor window, the "open" the file and
  execute it in the query window). .. then open and run each of the 4 insert_* files.
